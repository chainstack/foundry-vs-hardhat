## Project structure vs Hardhat

| Files          | Foundry   | Hardhat       |
| -------------- | --------- | ------------- |
| Contract files | /src      | /contracts    |
| Test files     | /src/test | /test         |
| Output         | /out      | /artifacts    |
| Dependencies   | /lib      | /node_modules |

## Testing with Foundry

| Pros                      | Cons                                                                        | Neither                  |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| No async/await            | Test names not as descriptive as in JS tests                                | tests writen in solidity |
| Tests require less code   | Cheats are difficult to understand at first                                 |
| Tests run super fast      | `expectRevert` assertion is weird                                           |
| Auto-generated gas report | `testFail` only tests if the test fails, not if the error is what we expect |
